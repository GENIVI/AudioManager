Version 0.3

***********************************************************************************************************
CURRENT STATUS
***********************************************************************************************************
The most important parts of the audiomanager are already there - nevertheless there are main features missing (pls look at the todos)
It should be sufficient to start working on a POC around it.

COMPILE PROGRAMS
***********************************************************************************************************

You will need some packages in order to comile the GENIVI AudioManager Proof of Concept, these are:
-dbus
-sqlite
-automotive-dlt
-google mock & google test (for the test - if you do not want them, uncomment these lines in Cmakelist.txt:
	add_subdirectory (database)
	add_subdirectory (routingInterface)
	add_subdirectory (controlInterface))
	
-doxygen (only for documentation)

More details in the CMake Files CmakeList.txt in the projects

on the top level of the folder you just received, there is a shall script "cmaker.sh" which can be invoked with a lot of different parameters. Invoking it with:

sh cmaker.sh all all

will create all neccessary folders and compile all plugins and applications except the PulseAudio Plugin.

after the script finished, you should have:

a /bin folder which contains: 
	AudioManager  

a /build folder which has all build objects (erase that if you need a clean build)

a /test folder which invokes all the tests for the audiomanager
