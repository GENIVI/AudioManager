Version 0.0.1

***********************************************************************************************************
CURRENT STATUS
***********************************************************************************************************
The most important parts of the audiomanager are already there - nevertheless there are main features missing (pls look at the todos)
It should be sufficient to start working on a POC around it.

COMPILE PROGRAMS
***********************************************************************************************************
- compile options with default values:

	 CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE

In order to change these options, you can modify this values with ccmake, do the appropriate changes in CmakeList.txt or via 
the commandline for cmake or (when installed via ccmake)

You will need some packages in order to comile the GENIVI AudioManager Daemon, these are:
	-dbus (only when DBUS_WRAPPER==ON) [tested on version 1.2.16]
	-sqlite3 [tested on version 3.6.22]
	-automotive-dlt [tested on version 2.2.0]
	-doxygen (only when WITH_DOCUMENTATION==ON) [tested on version 1.6.3]

	to install them in a build environment like Ubuntu you can use:
		sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev libsqlite3-dev doxygen git cmake build-essential

For building the tests, you will need the following packages:
	-google mock [tested on version 1.6.0-1] 
	-google test [tested on version 1.6.0]
	-python [tested on version 2.6]

	to install them in a build environment like Ubuntu you can use:
		sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev google-mock python2.6-dev

More details in the CMake Files CmakeList.txt in the projects.

The build was tested on a freshly setup LinuxMint 12 (don't like Unity) with the following steps:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev libsqlite3-dev doxygen libgtest-dev google-mock git cmake build-essential python2.6-dev

	git clone https://<kavi-account>:<kavi-password>@git.genivi.org/srv/git/DLT-daemon

In order to build the project (out of source build), please follow these instructions on the commandline:

	mkdir /build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make -j4

after the script finished, you should have:

	a bin/ folder which contains all executables and the libraries: 
	a build/ folder which has all build objects (erase that if you need a clean build)
	a doc/ folder in case you turned the documentation on

in order to install the AudioManager, you can do

	sudo make install

package generation is supported via CPack. To build packages, you have to 

	make genivi_package

this will create one package if your CMake version is < 2.8.5 (all binaries stripped):
	
	AudioManager-<git verison>-Linux.deb 

if your version is above, you will get 4 packages (all binaries stripped) :
	
	AudioManager-<git verison>-Linux-bin.deb   		[AudioManager binary]
	AudioManager-<git verison>-Linux-dev.deb   		[header files needed to compile plugins]
	AudioManager-<git verison>-Linux-sampleplugins.deb 	[sample plugins]
	AudioManager-<git verison>-Linux-tests.deb		[tests including tests for sample plugins, installed in the ~/AudioMAnagerTests]

to create a tar.gz file of all sources (not including .git, build and bin folder,config files), you can do:

	make package_source	

This will create the following package:

	AudioManager-<git verison>-Source.tar.gz

All packages will be placed in a folder called packages

The commandline options of the AudioManager:

	Usage:	AudioManagerDaemon [options]
	options:	
		-h: print this message	
		-i: info about current settings 	
		-v: print version	
		-d: daemonize AudioManager 	
		-p<path> path for sqlite database (default is in memory)	
		-t<port> port for telnetconnection	
		-m<max> number of max telnetconnections	
		-c<Name> use controllerPlugin <Name> (full path with .so ending)	
		-l<Name> replace command plugin directory with <Name> (full path)	
		-r<Name> replace routing plugin directory with <Name> (full path)	
		-L<Name> add command plugin directory with <Name> (full path)	
		-R<Name> add routing plugin directory with <Name> (full path)	

Telnet-Server:
   If you compile your AudioManager with TelnetServer support (cmake -DWITH_TELNET=ON), you will be able to set with commandline argument -t the port number and
   with -m the maximum supported connections. The default telnet port is 6060. 
   
   For example, launch a telnet session on port 6060:
      telnet localhost 6060
   
      #>Welcome to GENIVI AudioManager ver-0.0.1-37-ga004215
      #>
   
   press 'help' to get a list of all supported commands on this level:
   
      #>help
      ####################################################
      ####### The following commands are supported: ######
      ####################################################
      #
      #exit  - quit telnet session
      #get   - Go into 'get'-submenu
      #help  - show all possible commands
      #info  - Go into 'info'-submenu
      #list  - Go into 'list'-submenu
      #set   - Go into 'set'-submenu
      #
      #\>
   
   Now type one of these commands, for example 'get', followed with another 'help' to get a list of supported commands:
   
      #\>get
      #
      #\Get>help
      ####################################################
      ####### The following commands are supported: ######
      ####################################################
      # 
      #.. - one step back in menu tree (back to root folder)
      #exit  - close telnet session
      #help  - show all possible commands
      #recv  - show receiverversion 
      #routing  - show current routing
      #sendv - show senderversion
      #
      #\Get>
   
   You can also execute several commands in a line:
   
      #\Get>recv sendv .. help exit
      #   Receiver versions:
      #   Ctrl: 1 | Cmd: 1 | Routing: 1
      #   Sender versions:
      #   Ctrl: 1 | Cmd: 1 | Routing: 1
