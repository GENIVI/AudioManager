CURRENT STATUS
***********************************************************************************************************
The most important parts of the audiomanager are already there - nevertheless there are main features missing (pls look at the todos)
It should be sufficient to start working on a POC around it.

In order to change these options, you can modify this values with ccmake, do the appropriate changes in CmakeList.txt or via 
the commandline for cmake or (when installed via ccmake)

You will need some packages in order to comile the GENIVI AudioManager Daemon, these are:
	-dbus (only when DBUS_WRAPPER==ON) [tested on version 1.2.16]
	-sqlite3 [tested on version 3.6.22]
	-automotive-dlt [tested on version 2.2.0]
	-doxygen (only when WITH_DOCUMENTATION==ON) [tested on version 1.6.3]

	to install them in a build environment like Ubuntu you can use:
		sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev libsqlite3-dev doxygen git cmake build-essential

For building the tests, you will need the following packages:
	-google mock [tested on version 1.6.0-1] 
	-google test [tested on version 1.6.0]
	-python [tested on version 2.6]

	to install them in a build environment like Ubuntu you can use:
		sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev google-mock python2.6-dev

More details in the CMake Files CmakeList.txt in the projects.

The build was tested on a freshly setup LinuxMint 12 (don't like Unity) with the following steps:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev libsqlite3-dev doxygen libgtest-dev google-mock git cmake build-essential python2.6-dev

	git clone https://<kavi-account>:<kavi-password>@git.genivi.org/srv/git/DLT-daemon

In order to build the project (out of source build), please follow these instructions on the commandline:

	mkdir /build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make -j4

after the script finished, you should have:

	a /bin folder which contains all executables and the libraries: 
	a /build folder which has all build objects (erase that if you need a clean build)
	a /doc folder in case you turned the documentation on
