== License
The licenses of this project are split into two parts:
1) the AudioManagerDaemon, licensed under MPL 2.0
2) all other parts that serve as example code that can be taken to build up an own project with it -
    these parts are licensed with the MIT license
    
Contribution is done under GENIVI CLA or MPL2.0. 

== Version
The current version can be taken out of the git. The version 1.0.0 is the first GENIVI compliant code,in the compliance statement of discovery (2.0). 
For every GENIVI release, there is a release of the AudioManager, each of the releases have an own bugfix branch that will get the most important fixes.
Development is done on the master branch.

=== Versioning Scheme
The versioning scheme was decided in the February face2face 2012.
The firs number describes the release branch. This is 1 for discovery, 2 for excalibur and 3 for photon. For major features or release, the second number will be increased.
Each new GENIVI version (releases are every half year, around april and october) will get the current HEAD (for example 2.0.34 for excalibur) and release with the increase of the second number (2.1).
The next commit on the master branch gets then the new first numner (3) and starts from zero.

For the daemon the third number (for example 1.0.X) describes the patch version. The versions are automatically created by git during the build process.
The versioning scheme is used for the AudioManager daemon itself and for each of it's interfaces. The versioning of the Interfaces in EA is defined via the tag "version" and the name of the interfaceversion versionName, for example "CommandReceiveVersion". This information is generated into the interface header files and is used then by cmake to set the interface versions.
Whenever changes are done, the minor version of the interface needs to be incremented.

== Documentation
A very detailed documentation is provided by doxygen. In order to use this, please compile the AudioManager with
----
cmake -DWITH_DOCUMENTATION=ON
make

=== Passing options to cmake:

.-DVERSION="XXX"
When building the AudioManager without taking it from the git (and thus having a .git folder), you can set the version via passing _-DVERSION="XXX"_ to cmake.

.-DDBUS_SERVICE_PREFIX="XXX"
sets the service prefix for Dbus, default "org.genivi.audiomanager\0"

.-DDBUS_SERVICE_OBJECT_PATH="XXX"
sets the object path for Dbus, default "/org/genivi/audiomanager\0"

.-DDEFAULT_TELNETPORT="XXX"
sets the default telnetport, default 6060. Can be overwriten by command line parameter

.-DMAX_TELNETCONNECTIONS="XXX"
sets the default maximum number of telnetconnections, default is 3

In order to change these options, you can modify this values with ccmake, do the appropriate changes in 
CmakeList.txt or via the commandline for cmake or (when installed via ccmake)

=== Build dependencies
You will need to fullfill some dependencies in order to comile the GENIVI AudioManager Daemon, these are:

* dbus (only when DBUS_WRAPPER==ON) [tested on version 1.2.16]
* sqlite3 [tested on version 3.6.22]
* automotive-dlt [greater 2.5.0]                
* doxygen (only when WITH_DOCUMENTATION==ON) [tested on version 1.6.3]

To install them in a build environment like Ubuntu you can use:
----
sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev libsqlite3-dev doxygen git cmake build-essential
----

For building the tests, you will need the following packages:

* python [tested on version 2.6, should work on higher versions as well]

GoogleMock and GoogleTest are as source code integrated in the sourcetree
To install them in a build environment like Ubuntu you can use:
----
sudo apt-get install python2.6-dev
----

For compiling, you will need a compiler, linker etc. On most linux systems you will get this via
----
sudo apt-get install build-essential
----

More details in the CMake Files CmakeList.txt in the projects.

=== Compiling
To compile open a shell, browse to the AudioManager folder and 
----
mkdir /build
cd build
cmake ..
make
----

After the script finished, you should have:

* a bin/ folder which contains all executables and the libraries: 
* a build/ folder which has all build objects (erase that if you need a clean build)
* a doc/ folder in case you turned the documentation on

In order to install the AudioManager, you can do
----
sudo make install
----

Package generation is supported via CPack. To build packages, you have to 
----
make genivi_package
----

This will create one package if your CMake version is < 2.8.5 (all binaries stripped):
----
AudioManager-<git verison>-Linux.deb 
----

If your version is above 2.8.5, you will get 4 packages (all binaries stripped) :
	
* AudioManager-<git verison>-Linux-bin.deb   		[AudioManager binary]
* AudioManager-<git verison>-Linux-dev.deb   		[header files needed to compile plugins]
* AudioManager-<git verison>-Linux-sampleplugins.deb 	[sample plugins]
* AudioManager-<git verison>-Linux-tests.deb		[tests including tests for sample plugins, installed in the ~/AudioMAnagerTests]

In order to create a tar.gz file of all sources (not including .git, build and bin folder,config files), you can do:
----
make package_source			
----

This will create the following package:
'AudioManager-<git verison>-Source.tar.gz'

All packages will be placed in a folder called packages

=== Adding own plugins
Since the AudioManager needs to be completed with on plugins before it can be used, it provides a mechanism to keep the own sources away from the GENIVI code but compile them together.

TIP: Using this feature is simple: +
Just add a folder with the name _ProjectSpecific_ (be sure to name it excactly like this!) on the main level of the AudioManager folder. CMake will look for CMakeLists.txt in this folder and add all files that it finds in /include to the include path. You can use this to add subfolders with your own plugins and includes, and overwrite productspecific.h for example.

.Here is a sample CMakeLists.txt that can be placed in ProjectSpecific folder:
----
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6)

### set your own buildflags:
set (CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -g -Wall -Wextra -std=c++98 -D_GNU_SOURCE -pedantic -Wno-variadic-macros")

##overwrite priojecttypes.h:
CONFIGURE_FILE( ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/ProjectSpecific/overwrite/projecttypes.h ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include/projecttypes.h COPYONLY)

if(WITH_PLUGIN_ROUTING)
	add_subdirectory (../PluginRoutingInterfaceMyRoutingPlugin ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/PluginRoutingInterfaceMyRoutingPlugin )
endif(WITH_PLUGIN_ROUTING)

if(WITH_PLUGIN_CONTROL)
	add_subdirectory ( ../PluginControlInterfaceMyControlPlugin ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/PluginControlInterfaceMyControlPlugin)
endif(WITH_PLUGIN_CONTROL)

----

=== CommandLine options
The commandline options of the AudioManager:

----
AudioManagerDaemon Version: 3.0.11
Usage:	AudioManagerDaemon [options]
options:	
	-h: print this message	
	-i: info about current settings 	
	-v: print version	
	-d: daemonize AudioManager 	
	-T: DbusType to be used by CAmDbusWrapper (0=DBUS_SESSION[default], 1=DBUS_SYSTEM)	
	-p<path> path for sqlite database (default is in memory)	
	-t<port> port for telnetconnection	
	-m<max> number of max telnetconnections	
	-c<Name> use controllerPlugin <Name> (full path with .so ending)	
	-l<Name> replace command plugin directory with <Name> (full path)	
	-r<Name> replace routing plugin directory with <Name> (full path)	
	-L<Name> add command plugin directory with <Name> (full path)	
	-R<Name> add routing plugin directory with <Name> (full path)	
----  	


== Telnet Server
The audiomanager has a build- in telnetserver that serves for debuggin purposes.
If you compile your AudioManager with TelnetServer support (cmake -DWITH_TELNET=ON), you will be able to 
set with commandline argument -t the port number and with -m the maximum supported connections. 
The default telnet port is 6060. 
   
.For example, launch a telnet session on port 6060:
      telnet localhost 6060
   
      #>Welcome to GENIVI AudioManager ver-0.0.1-37-ga004215
      #>
   
.press 'help' to get a list of all supported commands on this level:
   
      #>help
      ####################################################
      ####### The following commands are supported: ######
      ####################################################
      #
      #exit  - quit telnet session
      #get   - Go into 'get'-submenu
      #help  - show all possible commands
      #info  - Go into 'info'-submenu
      #list  - Go into 'list'-submenu
      #set   - Go into 'set'-submenu
      #
      #\>
   
.Now type one of these commands, for example 'get', followed with another 'help' to get a list of supported commands:
   
      #\>get
      #
      #\Get>help
      ####################################################
      ####### The following commands are supported: ######
      ####################################################
      # 
      #.. - one step back in menu tree (back to root folder)
      #exit  - close telnet session
      #help  - show all possible commands
      #recv  - show receiverversion 
      #routing  - show current routing
      #sendv - show senderversion
      #
      #\Get>
   
.You can also execute several commands in a line:
   
      #\Get>recv sendv .. help exit
      #   Receiver versions:
      #   Ctrl: 1 | Cmd: 1 | Routing: 1
      #   Sender versions:
      #   Ctrl: 1 | Cmd: 1 | Routing: 1
      ####################################################
      ######## The following commands are supported: ######
      ####################################################
      #
      #exit  - quit telnet session
      #get   - Go into 'get'-submenu
      #help  - show all possible commands
      #info  - Go into 'info'-submenu
      #list  - Go into 'list'-submenu
      #set   - Go into 'set'-submenu
      #
      #Your wish is my command ... bye!
      #Connection closed by foreign host.



== Code Formatting
The source code if formatted with eclipse, the style sheet used can be found in the cmake folder:
----
cmake/AudioManager_Codestyle.xml
----

== Working on the code & contribution

.First get the code from the git:
        git clone 

.Get an overview of all branches:
        git branch

.Switch to the branch you want to work on (see versioning schmeme, the master is the feature branch) and verify that it has switched (* changed)
        git checkout <your branch>
        git branch

.Best practice is to create a local branch based on the current branch:
        git branch working_branch

Start working, best practice is to commit smaller, compilable peaced during the work that makes it easier to 
handle later on.

.If you want to commit you changes, send them to the audiomanager-dev list, you can create a patch like this:
        git format-patch working_branch <your branch>

This creates a set of patches that are published via the mailing list.The patches will be discussed and then merged & uploaded on the git by the maintainer.

Patches can be accepted either under GENIVI Cla or MPL 2.0 (see section License). Please be sure that the signed-off-by is set correctly. For more, check out http://gerrit.googlecode.com/svn/documentation/2.0/user-signedoffby.html
