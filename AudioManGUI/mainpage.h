 * \todo Currently the GUI does only support a very basic interface for updates. For example every time there is a new connection, it retrieves the complete list of connections new.
 * This should be changed into a smarter way.
 * \todo Improve the interface further
 * \todo Volume changes are only set, not read out before setting. This results into a none nice way of changing the volume
 * \todo nicer layouts.
